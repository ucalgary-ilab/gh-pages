These dynamic tactile markers can be easily reconfigured and used to annotate static raised line tactile graphics, including maps, graphs, and diagrams. We developed a hardware prototype that actuates magnetic tactile markers driven by low-cost and scalable electromagnetic coil arrays, which can be fabricated with standard printed circuit board manufacturing.

Modern mapping software attempts to alleviate this limitation by presenting digital terrain using 3D views. However, 3D views introduce occlusion, complicate distance estimations, and typically require more complex interactions. In contrast, our approach reveals depth information via shearing animations on 2D maps, and can be paired with existing interactions such as pan and zoom. We examine explicit, integrated, and hybrid interactions for triggering relief shearing and present a version that uses device tilt to control depth effects.

Inspired by current UI programming practices, we introduce a four-step workflow-create elements, abstract attributes, specify behaviors, and propagate changes-for Swarm UI programming. We propose a set of direct physical manipulation techniques to support each step in this workflow. To demonstrate these concepts, we developed Reactile, a Swarm UI programming environment that actuates a swarm of small magnets and displays spatial information of program states using a DLP projector.

The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament that produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. Although these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four sensors attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space.

No single instance of these methods, either in the form of orthographic projections or perspectival representation, can address all questions regarding the design, but as a whole, they demonstrate a comprehensive range of information about the building or object they intend to represent. This explicates an inevitable degree of deficiency in representation, regardless of its type. In addition, perspective-based optical illusions manipulate our spatial perception by deliberately misrepresenting the reality. In this regard, they are not new concepts to architectural representation. As a consequence, Optically Illusive Architecture (OIA) is proposed, not as a solution to fill the gap between the representing and represented spaces, but as a design paradigm whose concept derives from and accounts for this gap. By OIA we aim to cast light to an undeniable role of viewpoints in designing architectural spaces. The idea is to establish a methodology in a way that the deficiency of current representational techniques—manifested as specific thread of optical illusions—flourishes into thoughtful results embodied as actual architectural spaces. Within our design paradigm, we define a framework to be able to effectively analyze its precedents, generate new space, and evaluate their efficiencies. Moreover, the framework raises a hierarchical set of questions to differentiate OIA from a visual gimmick.

In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values.

In multiscale navigation, such as digital map navigation, pan and zoom are the predominant interactions. A position-based input mapping (e.g. grabbing metaphor) is intuitive for such interactions, but is prone to arm fatigue. This work focuses on improving digital map navigation in AR with mid-air hand gestures, using a horizontal intangible map display. First, we conducted a user study to explore the effects of handedness (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based). From these findings we designed DiveZoom and TerraceZoom, two novel hybrid techniques that smoothly transition between position- and rate-based mappings. A second user study evaluated these designs. Our results indicate that the introduced input-mapping transitions can reduce perceived arm fatigue with limited impact on performance.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"vr-2019-satriadi.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"vr-2019-satriadi.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/seminar.json":[{date:"2021-09-13",name:"Pedro Lopes",affiliation:"University of Chicago",url:"http://plopes.org/",title:"Integrating Interactive Devices with the User’s Body",abstract:"When we look back to the early days of computing, user and device were distant, often located in separate rooms. Then, in the ’70s, personal computers 'moved in' with users. In the ’90s, mobile devices moved computing into users’ pockets. More recently, wearable devices brought computing into constant physical contact with the user’s skin. These transitions proved useful: moving closer to users allowed interactive devices to sense more of their user and act more personal. The main question that drives my research is: what is the next interface paradigm that supersedes wearable devices? The primary way researchers have been investigating this is by asking where future interactive devices will be located with respect to the user’s body. Many posit that the next generation of interfaces will be implanted inside the user’s body. However, I argue that their location with respect to the user’s body is not the primary factor; in fact, implanted devices are already happening in that we have pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc. Instead, I argue that the key factor is how devices will integrate with the user’s biological senses and actuators. This body-device integration allowed us to engineer interactive devices that intentionally borrow parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body. For example, one such type of body-integrated devices, which I have advanced recently, are interactive systems based on electrical muscle stimulation. These devices move their user’s muscles using computer-controlled electrical impulses, achieving the functionality of robotic exoskeletons without the bulky motors. The key insight is that engineering devices that intentionally borrow parts of the user’s biology puts forward a new generation of miniaturized devices; allowing us to circumvent traditional physical constraints. For instance, in the case of our devices based on electrical muscle stimulation, they demonstrate how our body-device integration circumvents the constraints imposed by the ratio of electrical power and size of a motor (i.e., the stronger/larger a motor is, the more current needed to actuate it). Taking this further, we demonstrate how our body-device integration approach allowed us to also miniaturize thermal feedback (hot/cold sensations) without the need for power-hungry devices like Peltiers, air conditioners, or heaters. We believe that these bodily-integrated devices are the natural succession to wearable interfaces and allow us to investigate how interfaces might connect to our bodies in a more direct and personal way.",bio:"Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

What holds widely adopted use back is the limited ability to modify and fabricate existing models. It may seem like a portable format already exist, as laser cut models are already widely shared in the form of 2D cutting plans. However, such files are susceptible to variations in cutter properties (aka kerf) and do not allow modifying the model in any meaningful way. I consider this format machine specific. In computing, this problem was solved in the 50s by developing compilers. This allowed developers to abstract away from the hardware and as a result, write code that remained relevant to this day. The resulting code is portable, e.g. it can be transferred from one machine to another. This transition has revolutionized not only computing but also all fields that use digital formats like desktop publishing, digital video, digital audio, etc. I believe that by transitioning towards a portable format for laser cutting we can make a similar transition from 1000s of users and one-off models towards millions of users and advanced models developed by multiple creators. My first take on the challenge is to see how far we get by building on the de-facto standard, i.e., 2D cutting plans. I wrote software tools to modify 2D cutting plans, replacing non-portable elements with portable counterparts. This makes the models portable, but it is still hard to modify them. I thus take a more radical approach, which is to move to a 3D exchange format (kyub). This guarantees portability by generating a new machine-specific 2D cutting plan for the local machine when exported. And the models inherently allow for parametric modifications. Instead, it raises the question of compatibility: Files already exist in 2D—how to get them into 3D? I demonstrate a software tool, assembler3, to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the model encoded in a 2D cutting plan, allows modifying it using a 3D editor, and re-encodes it to a 2D cutting plan. I demonstrate how this approach allows me to make a much wider range of modifications, including scaling, changing material thickness, and even remixing models.",bio:"Thijs Roumen is a PhD candidate in Human Computer Interaction in the lab of Patrick Baudisch, Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.

Mismatches in perception, understanding and action between road users can easily cause accidents. We are exploring how drivers implicitly communicate and coordinate with others on the road, and to assess how these driving interactions differ across cultures. By staging situations that demand negotiation, such as ambiguous four-way stops, we can capture how participants communicate with other drivers or pedestrians to coordinate joint action, implicitly through the movements of their virtual car or bodily movement, or explicitly through verbal or gestural exchange.

By making animation as easy, accessible, and fluid as sketching, I intend to make dynamic graphics a powerful medium to think, create, and communicate rapidly.',bio:"Rubaiat Habib is a Sr. Research Scientist at Adobe Research.

My research focuses on the physical side by bringing interactivity to everyday things. I believe this vision is only achievable if people with varying backgrounds and abilities can work together in an accessible and collaborative environment. In this talk, I will describe two major threads of research in interactive everyday things and hardware prototyping tools. The first thread investigates interactive systems to sense the context of use of the things or estimate a user’s intention when touch input data is noisy. For example, I will demonstrate a tablecloth augmented with a fabric sensor that can sense and recognize non-metallic objects placed on a table, such as food, different types of fruits, liquids, plastic, and paper products. I will also show examples of how this technique can be used for contextual applications. The second thread investigates tools to lower the bar of entry to prototyping electronics, which is an essential skill needed to create smart everyday things. The goal of this line of work is to enable more people with varying backgrounds and abilities to create smart everyday things and eventually a better user experience of smart environments. For example, I will demonstrate an audio-tactile tutorial system for blind or low vision learners to understand circuit diagrams, which is an important task in the circuit prototyping pipeline. Both of these threads share a common goal that is to create a better user experience in smart environments.",bio:"Xing-Dong Yang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College.

In this effort, various types of generic devices of actuated TUIs have been investigated including pin-based shape displays, actuated curve interfaces, and swarm user interfaces. While these approaches are intended to be dynamically reconfigurable to offer generic interactivity, each hardware is inherently limited to the fixed configurations. How can we further expand the versatility of the actuated TUIs for fully expanding their capability for tangible interactions and motion / shape representations?\n\nIn my talk, I propose a ‘mechanical shell’, a design concept for actuated TUIs with modular interchangeable components that extends and converts the shape, motion, and interactivity of the hardware. By doing so, compared with the actuated TUI itself, each mechanical shell would bring much more specialized and customized interactivity, while, as the whole architecture, the system can adapt to much more versatile interactions. I present two research instances that demonstrate this concept based-on pin-based shape display and swarm user interface, and introduce proof-of-concept implementation as well as a range of applications. By introducing the novel interaction architecture, my research envisions the future of the physical environment where active and passive machines exist together for enriching tangible and embodied interactions.",bio:"Ken is an interaction designer and HCI researcher from Japan.
