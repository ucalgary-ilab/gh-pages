The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament which produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. While these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four FSRs attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. While the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin. Our design allows violinists to naturally create music for interactive performance and improvisation without requiring new instrumental techniques. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, experiments leading to the sensing fingerboard, and performative applications of the instrument.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"nime-2020-ko.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"nime-2020-ko.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"+yqD":function(e){e.exports={date:"2020-04",title:"Autonomous Vehicle-Cyclist Interaction: Peril and Promise",authors:["Ming Hou","Karthik Mahadevan","Sowmya Somanath","Ehud Sharlin","Lora Oehlberg"],series:"CHI 2020",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376884",keywords:"autonomous vehicle-cyclist interaction, interfaces for communicating intent and awareness",video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsgbUeAaFfI",talk:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtxkWAW9B1s",pages:12,abstract:"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will redefine interactions between road users. Presently, cyclists and drivers communicate through implicit cues (vehicle motion) and explicit but imprecise signals (hand gestures, horns). Future AVs could consistently communicate awareness and intent and other feedback to cyclists based on their sensor data. We present an exploration of AV-cyclist interaction, starting with preliminary design studies which informed the implementation of an immersive VR AV-cyclist simulator, and the design and evaluation of a number of AV-cyclist interfaces. Our findings suggest that AV-cyclist interfaces can improve rider confidence in lane merging scenarios. We contribute an AV-cyclist immersive simulator, insights on trade-offs of various aspects of AV-cyclist interaction design including modalities, location, and complexity, and positive results suggesting improved rider confidence due to AV-cyclist interaction. While we are encouraged by the potential positive impact AV-cyclist interfaces can have on cyclist culture, we also emphasize the risks over-reliance can pose to cyclists.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2020-hou.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2020-hou.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"1D+r":function(e){e.exports={date:"2016-05",title:"Towards An Understanding of Mobile Touch Navigation in a Stereoscopic Viewing Environment for 3D Data Exploration",authors:["David Lopez","Lora Oehlberg","Candemir Doger","Tobias Isenberg"],series:"TVCG 2016",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2440233",keywords:"visualization of 3D data, human-computer interaction, expert interaction, direct-touch input, mobile displays, stereoscopic environments, VR, AR, conceptual model of interaction, interaction reference frame mapping, observational study",video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBtHgTYpJl0",talk:"https://vimeo.com/245846750",pages:13,abstract:"We discuss touch-based navigation of 3D visualizations in a combined monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing environment.

We show how this mapping supports interactive data exploration, but may also lead to conflicts between the stereoscopic and monoscopic views due to users' movement in space; we resolve these problems through synchronization.

We describe findings from a study where pairs collaborated to complete shared navigation and search tasks. We illustrate the benefits of providing the desktop user with a view that is elevated, manipulable, and decoupled from the outdoor user. In addition, we articulate how participants overcame challenges in communicating environmental information and navigational cues, negotiated control of the view, and used the drone as a tool for sharing experiences.

However, with the current tools, sketched contents are inherently static, floating in mid air without responding to the real world. This paper introduces a new way to embed dynamic and responsive graphics in the real world. In RealitySketch, the user draws graphical elements on a mobile AR screen and binds them with physical objects in real-time and improvisational ways, so that the sketched elements dynamically move with the corresponding physical motion. The user can also quickly visualize and analyze real-world phenomena through responsive graph plots or interactive visualizations. This paper contributes to a set of interaction techniques that enable capturing, parameterizing, and visualizing real-world motion without pre-defined programs and configurations.

To examine the challenges of remote critique, we conducted an observational lab study in which participants critiqued pairs of physical prototypes (prosthetic hands) for a face-to-face or remote collaborator. In both conditions, participants' material experiences were an important part of their critique, however their attention was divided between interacting with the prototype and finding strategies to communicate `invisible' features.

To provide an understanding of what people do in mobile video collaboration, we conducted an observational study where pairs of participants completed tasks using a mobile video conferencing system.

Reading and interpreting topography and relief on terrain maps is an important aspect of map use, but extracting depth information from 2D maps is notoriously difficult. Modern mapping software attempts to alleviate this limitation by presenting digital terrain using 3D views. However, 3D views introduce occlusion, complicate distance estimations, and typically require more complex interactions. In contrast, our approach reveals depth information via shearing animations on 2D maps, and can be paired with existing interactions such as pan and zoom. We examine explicit, integrated, and hybrid interactions for triggering relief shearing and present a version that uses device tilt to control depth effects. Our evaluation shows that these interactive techniques improve depth perception when compared to standard 2D and perspective views.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2015-willett.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2015-willett.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/people/zachary-mckendrick.json":{name:"Zachary McKendrick",type:"phd",url:"https://scpa.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/profiles/zachary-mckendrick",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-mckendrick-7a24bb3b",dir:"content/output/people",base:"zachary-mckendrick.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"zachary-mckendrick.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2015-aseniero.json":{date:"2015-04",title:"Stratos: Using Visualization to Support Decisions in Strategic Software Release Planning",authors:["Bon Adriel Aseniero","Tiffany Wun","David Ledo","Guenther Ruhe","Anthony Tang","Sheelagh Carpendale"],series:"CHI 2015",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702426",keywords:"software engineering, information visualization, release planning",video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm57aHjTAYc",pages:10,abstract:"Software is typically developed incrementally and released in stages.

However, raised line tactile graphics created with traditional materials such as embossing are static. While available refreshable displays can dynamically change the content, they are still too expensive for many users, and are limited in size. These factors limit wide-spread adoption and the representation of large graphics or data sets. In this paper, we present FluxMaker, an inexpensive scalable system that renders dynamic information on top of static tactile graphics with movable tactile markers. These dynamic tactile markers can be easily reconfigured and used to annotate static raised line tactile graphics, including maps, graphs, and diagrams. We developed a hardware prototype that actuates magnetic tactile markers driven by low-cost and scalable electromagnetic coil arrays, which can be fabricated with standard printed circuit board manufacturing. We evaluate our prototype with six participants with visual impairments and found positive results across four application areas: location finding or navigating on tactile maps, data analysis, and physicalization, feature identification for tactile graphics, and drawing support.

Remixed designs on Thingiverse are predominantly generated designs from Customizer a built-in web app for adjusting parametric designs. However, we find that these designs do not elicit subsequent user activity and the authors who generate them tend not to contribute additional content to Thingiverse. Outside of Customizer, influential sources of remixing include complex assemblies and design primitives, as well as non-physical resources posing as physical designs.

As citizen science is increasingly used to describe a wide range of activities, we begin by presenting a framework of citizen science genres. We then present findings from four interlocking qualitative studies and technological interventions of community air quality monitoring efforts, examining the motivations and capacities of citizen participants and characterizing their alignment with different types of citizen science.

Developing a better understanding of this discovery process can help inform the design of visualizations for the general public, which in turn can help make data more accessible. To unpack this problem, we conducted a lab study in which participants were free to use their own methods to discover the functionality of a connected set of interactive visualizations of public energy data.

While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations.

In this talk, I\'m going to present my research on animation, storytelling, and design, including the design of Sketchbook Motion that was crowned as "The best iPad app of the year 2016" by Apple.

My research focuses on the physical side by bringing interactivity to everyday things. I believe this vision is only achievable if people with varying backgrounds and abilities can work together in an accessible and collaborative environment. In this talk, I will describe two major threads of research in interactive everyday things and hardware prototyping tools. The first thread investigates interactive systems to sense the context of use of the things or estimate a user’s intention when touch input data is noisy. For example, I will demonstrate a tablecloth augmented with a fabric sensor that can sense and recognize non-metallic objects placed on a table, such as food, different types of fruits, liquids, plastic, and paper products. I will also show examples of how this technique can be used for contextual applications. The second thread investigates tools to lower the bar of entry to prototyping electronics, which is an essential skill needed to create smart everyday things. The goal of this line of work is to enable more people with varying backgrounds and abilities to create smart everyday things and eventually a better user experience of smart environments. For example, I will demonstrate an audio-tactile tutorial system for blind or low vision learners to understand circuit diagrams, which is an important task in the circuit prototyping pipeline. Both of these threads share a common goal that is to create a better user experience in smart environments.",bio:"Xing-Dong Yang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College.

In this effort, various types of generic devices of actuated TUIs have been investigated including pin-based shape displays, actuated curve interfaces, and swarm user interfaces. While these approaches are intended to be dynamically reconfigurable to offer generic interactivity, each hardware is inherently limited to the fixed configurations. How can we further expand the versatility of the actuated TUIs for fully expanding their capability for tangible interactions and motion / shape representations?\n\nIn my talk, I propose a ‘mechanical shell’, a design concept for actuated TUIs with modular interchangeable components that extends and converts the shape, motion, and interactivity of the hardware. By doing so, compared with the actuated TUI itself, each mechanical shell would bring much more specialized and customized interactivity, while, as the whole architecture, the system can adapt to much more versatile interactions. I present two research instances that demonstrate this concept based-on pin-based shape display and swarm user interface, and introduce proof-of-concept implementation as well as a range of applications.

While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators.

Dynamic 3D Printing can assemble an arbitrary three-dimensional shape from a large number of small physical elements. Also, it can disassemble the shape back to elements and reconstruct a new shape. Dynamic 3D Printing combines the capabilities of 3D printers and shape displays: Like conventional 3D printing, it can generate arbitrary and graspable three-dimensional shapes, while allowing shapes to be rapidly formed and reformed as in a shape display. To demonstrate the idea, we describe the design and implementation of Dynablock, a working prototype of a dynamic 3D printer. Dynablock can form a three-dimensional shape in seconds by assembling 3,000 9 mm blocks, leveraging a 24 x 16 pin-based shape display as a parallel assembler. Dynamic 3D printing is a step toward achieving our long-term vision in which 3D printing becomes an interactive medium, rather than the means for fabrication that it is today. In this paper, we explore possibilities for this vision by illustrating application scenarios that are difficult to achieve with conventional 3D printing or shape display systems.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"uist-2018-suzuki.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"uist-2018-suzuki.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},KI45:function(e,t){e.exports=function(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}}},KMRZ:function(e){e.exports={date:"2019-06",title:"Sketching and Ideation Activities for Situated Visualization Design",authors:["Nathalie Bressa","Kendra Wannamaker","Henrik Korsgaard","Wesley Willett","Jo Vermeulen"],series:"DIS 2019",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3322276.3322326",keywords:"ideation, design workshops, situated visualization, information visualization, small displays, sketching",abstract:"We report on findings from seven design workshops that used ideation and sketching activities to prototype new situated visualizations - representations of data that are displayed in proximity to the physical referents (such as people, objects, and locations) to which the data is related.

Focusing on small displays as a target platform, we reflect on our experiences of using a diverse range of sketching activities, materials, and prompts.

To design discoverable gestures, we need to understand what gestures people expect to use. We explore how the scale of AR affects the gestures people expect to use to interact with 3D holograms. Using an elicitation study, we asked participants to generate gestures in response to holographic task referents, where we varied the scale of holograms from desktop-scale to room-scale objects. We found that the scale of objects and scenes in the AR experience moderates the generated gestures. Most gestures were informed by physical interaction, and when people interacted from a distance, they sought a good perspective on the target object before and during the interaction. These results suggest that gesture designers need to account for scale, and should not simply reuse gestures across different hologram sizes.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"dis-2018-pham.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"dis-2018-pham.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"Ln+l":function(e){e.exports={date:"2018-04",title:"Geocaching with a Beam: Shared Outdoor Activities through a Telepresence Robot with 360 Degree Viewing",authors:["Yasamin Heshmat","Brennan Jones","Xiaoxuan Xiong","Carman Neustaedter","Anthony Tang","Bernhard E.

When readers wish to engage more deeply with the data, they can collect, arrange, compare, and navigate the document using the embedded word-scale visualizations, permitting more visualization-centric analyses.

To understand how people perceive "wind" generated from WindyWall, we conducted a pilot study of wind magnitude perception using different wind activation patterns from WindyWall. Our findings suggest that: horizontal wind activations are perceived more readily than vertical ones, and that people\'s perceptions of wind are highly variable-most individuals will rate airflow differently in subsequent exposures.

We propose a set of guidelines for the design of an augmented prop that fits with the existing world of unpredictable improvised performance.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"tei-2019-mikalauskas.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"tei-2019-mikalauskas.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"V+O7":function(e,t,i){i("aPfg")("Set")},V7Et:function(e,t,i){var n=i("2GTP"),a=i("M1xp"),o=i("JB68"),s=i("tEej"),r=i("v6xn");e.exports=function(e,t){var i=1==e,c=2==e,l=3==e,u=4==e,p=6==e,h=5==e||p,d=t||r;return function(t,r,m){for(var g,f,y=o(t),v=a(y),b=n(r,m,3),w=s(v.length),j=0,k=i?d(t,w):c?d(t,0):void 0;w>j;j++)if((h||j in v)&&(f=b(g=v[j],j,y),e))if(i)k[j]=f;else if(f)switch(e){case 3:return!0;case 5:return g;case 6:return j;case 2:k.push(g)}else if(u)return!1;return p?-1:l||u?u:k}}},VKFn:function(e,t,i){i("bBy9"),i("FlQf"),e.exports=i("ldVq")},Wu5q:function(e,t,i){"use strict";var n=i("2faE").f,a=i("oVml"),o=i("XJU/"),s=i("2GTP"),r=i("EXMj"),c=i("oioR"),l=i("MPFp"),u=i("UO39"),p=i("TJWN"),h=i("jmDH"),d=i("6/1s").fastKey,m=i("n3ko"),g=h?"_s":"size",f=function(e,t){var i,n=d(t);if("F"!==n)return e._i[n];for(i=e._f;i;i=i.n)if(i.k==t)return i};e.exports={getConstructor:function(e,t,i,l){var u=e(function(e,n){r(e,u,t,"_i"),e._t=t,e._i=a(null),e._f=void 0,e._l=void 0,e[g]=0,null!=n&&c(n,i,e[l],e)});return o(u.prototype,{clear:function(){for(var e=m(this,t),i=e._i,n=e._f;n;n=n.n)n.r=!0,n.p&&(n.p=n.p.n=void 0),delete i[n.i];e._f=e._l=void 0,e[g]=0},delete:function(e){var i=m(this,t),n=f(i,e);if(n){var a=n.n,o=n.p;delete i._i[n.i],n.r=!0,o&&(o.n=a),a&&(a.p=o),i._f==n&&(i._f=a),i._l==n&&(i._l=o),i[g]--}return!!n},forEach:function(e){m(this,t);for(var i,n=s(e,arguments.length>1?arguments[1]:void 0,3);i=i?i.n:this._f;)for(n(i.v,i.k,this);i&&i.r;)i=i.p},has:function(e){return!!f(m(this,t),e)}}),h&&n(u.prototype,"size",{get:function(){return m(this,t)[g]}}),u},def:function(e,t,i){var n,a,o=f(e,t);return o?o.v=i:(e._l=o={i:a=d(t,!0),k:t,v:i,p:n=e._l,n:void 0,r:!1},e._f||(e._f=o),n&&(n.n=o),e[g]++,"F"!==a&&(e._i[a]=o)),e},getEntry:f,setStrong:function(e,t,i){l(e,t,function(e,i){this._t=m(e,t),this._k=i,this._l=void 0},function(){for(var e=this._k,t=this._l;t&&t.r;)t=t.p;return this._t&&(this._l=t=t?t.n:this._t._f)?u(0,"keys"==e?t.k:"values"==e?t.v:[t.k,t.v]):(this._t=void 0,u(1))},i?"entries":"values",!i,!0),p(t)}}},Wziy:function(e,t,i){"use strict";var n=function(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}};Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var a=n(i("q1tI")),o=i("imt6");function s(){var e=arguments.length>0&&void 0!==arguments[0]?arguments[0]:{},t=e.enabled,i=void 0!==t&&t,n=e.hybrid,a=void 0!==n&&n,o=e.hasQuery;return i&&(!a||a&&(void 0!==o&&o))}t.isAmp=s,t.useAmp=function(){return s(a.default.useContext(o.AmpModeContext))},t.withAmp=function(e){var t=(arguments.length>1&&void 0!==arguments[1]?arguments[1]:{}).hybrid,i=void 0!==t&&t;function n(){var t=arguments.length>0&&void 0!==arguments[0]?arguments[0]:{},n=a.default.useContext(o.AmpModeContext);return n.enabled=!0,n.hybrid=i,a.default.createElement(e,t)}return n.__nextAmpOnly=!i,n.getInitialProps=e.getInitialProps,n}},"XJU/":function(e,t,i){var n=i("NegM");e.exports=function(e,t,i){for(var a in t)i&&e[a]?e[a]=t[a]:n(e,a,t[a]);return e}},XNPm:function(e){e.exports={date:"2018-04",title:"Communicating Awareness and Intent in Autonomous Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction",authors:["Karthik Mahadevan","Sowmya Somanath","Ehud Sharlin"],series:"CHI 2018",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174003",keywords:"autonomous vehicle-pedestrian interaction, perceived awareness and intent in autonomous vehicles",pages:12,video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_hhcGVREGA",talk:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08OEKuz93dY",abstract:"Drivers use nonverbal cues such as vehicle speed, eye gaze, and hand gestures to communicate awareness and intent to pedestrians.

In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car. We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a

Existing Swarm UI applications are written using a robot programming framework: users work on a computer screen and think in terms of low-level controls. In contrast, our approach allows programmers to work in physical space by directly manipulating objects and think in terms of high-level interface design. Inspired by current UI programming practices, we introduce a four-step workflow-create elements, abstract attributes, specify behaviors, and propagate changes-for Swarm UI programming. We propose a set of direct physical manipulation techniques to support each step in this workflow. To demonstrate these concepts, we developed Reactile, a Swarm UI programming environment that actuates a swarm of small magnets and displays spatial information of program states using a DLP projector.

Technologies like lightweight wireless displays, mixed reality hardware, and autonomous vehicles are making it increasingly easier to display data in-context. While researchers and artists have already begun to create embedded data representations, the benefits, trade-offs, and even the language necessary to describe and compare these approaches remain unexplored. In this paper, we formalize the notion of physical data referents – the real-world entities and spaces to which data corresponds – and examine the relationship between referents and the visual and physical representations of their data. We differentiate situated representations, which display data in proximity to data referents, and embedded representations, which display data so that it spatially coincides with data referents. Drawing on examples from visualization, ubiquitous computing, and art, we explore the role of spatial indirection, scale, and interaction for embedded representations. We also examine the tradeoffs between non-situated, situated, and embedded data displays, including both visualizations and physicalizations.

For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations.

To mitigate these problems we contribute proxemic-aware controls, which exploit the spatial relationships between a person's handheld device and all surrounding appliances to create a dynamic appliance control interface. Specifically, a person can discover and select an appliance by the way one orients a mobile device around the room, and then progressively view the appliance's status and control its features in increasing detail by simply moving towards it. We illustrate proxemic-aware controls of assorted appliances through various scenarios.

The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children's stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child's playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children's stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions.

To mitigate this, we created Pineal, a design tool that lets end-users: (1) modify 3D models to include a smart watch or phone as its heart; (2) specify high-level interactive behaviours through visual programming; and (3) have the phone or watch act out such behaviours as the objects\' "smarts".

This work focuses on improving digital map navigation in AR with mid-air hand gestures, using a horizontal intangible map display. First, we conducted a user study to explore the effects of handedness (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based).

Mention",abstract:"In the coming years, emergency calling services in North America will begin to incorporate new modalities for reporting emergencies, including video-based calling. The challenge is that we know little of how video calling systems should be designed and what benefits or challenges video calling might bring. We conducted observations and contextual interviews within three emergency response call centres to investigate these points. We focused on the work practices of call takers and dispatchers. Results show that video calls could provide valuable contextual information about a situation and help to overcome call taker challenges with information ambiguity, location, deceit, and communication issues. Yet video calls have the potential to introduce issues around control, information overload, and privacy if systems are not designed well. These results point to the need to think about emergency video calling along a continuum of visual modalities ranging from audio calls accompanied with images or video clips to one-way video streams to two-way video streams where camera control and camera work need to be carefully designed.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2018-neustaedter.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2018-neustaedter.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"yYy+":function(e,t,i){"use strict";i.r(t);var n=i("pbKT"),a=i.n(n),o=i("0iUn"),s=i("sLSF"),r=i("Tit0"),c=i("MI3g"),l=i("a7VT"),u=i("q1tI"),p=i.n(u);i("IujW");function h(e){var t=function(){if("undefined"==typeof Reflect||!a.a)return!1;if(a.a.sham)return!1;if("function"==typeof Proxy)return!0;try{return Date.prototype.toString.call(a()(Date,[],function(){})),!0}catch(e){return!1}}();return function(){var i,n=Object(l.default)(e);if(t){var o=Object(l.default)(this).constructor;i=a()(n,arguments,o)}else i=n.apply(this,arguments);return Object(c.default)(this,i)}}var d=function(e){Object(r.default)(i,e);var t=h(i);function i(){return Object(o.default)(this,i),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(s.default)(i,[{key:"render",value:function(){return p.a.createElement("footer",null,p.a.createElement("div",{className:"ui center aligned container"},p.a.createElement("div",{className:"ui section divider"}),p.a.createElement("img",{style:{maxWidth:"180px",margin:"30px auto"},src:"/static/images/logo-6.png"}),p.a.createElement("div",{className:"content"},p.a.createElement("img",{style:{maxWidth:"200px",margin:"0px auto"},src:"/static/images/logo-4.png"}),p.a.createElement("div",{className:"sub header"},"Department of Computer Science"))))}}]),i}(p.a.Component);t.default=d},zRIs:function(e){e.exports={date:"2015-04",title:"Lightweight Relief Shearing for Enhanced Terrain Perception on Interactive Maps",authors:["Wesley Willett","Bernhard Jenny","Tobias Isenberg","Pierre Dragicevic"],series:"CHI 2015",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702172",keywords:"plan oblique relief, interaction, depth perception, terrain maps, relief shearing",pages:10,video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW31lmzQzpc",abstract:"We explore interactive relief shearing, a set of non-intrusive, direct manipulation interactions that expose depth and shape information in terrain maps using ephemeral animations. Reading and interpreting topography and relief on terrain maps is an important aspect of map use, but extracting depth information from 2D maps is notoriously difficult. Modern mapping software attempts to alleviate this limitation by presenting digital terrain using 3D views. However, 3D views introduce occlusion, complicate distance estimations, and typically require more complex interactions. In contrast, our approach reveals depth information via shearing animations on 2D maps, and can be paired with existing interactions such as pan and zoom. We examine explicit, integrated, and hybrid interactions for triggering relief shearing and present a version that uses device tilt to control depth effects. Our evaluation shows that these interactive techniques improve depth perception when compared to standard 2D and perspective views.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2015-willett.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2015-willett.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},zXhZ:function(e,t,i){var n=i("5K7Z"),a=i("93I4"),o=i("ZW5q");e.exports=function(e,t){if(n(e),a(t)&&t.constructor===e)return t;var i=o.f(e);return(0,i.resolve)(t),i.promise}}},[["mDBt","5d41","9da1"]]]);
