Conventional video chat systems are insufficient for many situations because they present a single view of the object in a flattened image. To understand how this limited perspective affects collaboration, we designed the Remote Manipulator (ReMa), which can reproduce orientation manipulations on a proxy object at a remote site. We conducted two studies with ReMa, with two main findings. First, a shared perspective is more effective and preferred compared to the opposing perspective offered by conventional video chat systems. Second, the physical proxy and video chat complement one another in a combined system: people used the physical proxy to understand objects, and used video chat to perform gestures and confirm remote actions.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2018-feick.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2018-feick.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2018-ledo.json":{date:"2018-04",title:"Evaluation Strategies for HCI Toolkit Research",authors:["David Ledo","Steven Houben","Jo Vermeulen","Nicolai Marquardt","Lora Oehlberg","Saul Greenberg"],series:"CHI 2018",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173610",keywords:"user interfaces, design, evaluation, prototyping, toolkits",pages:17,video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lAwhCk60C4",talk:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOhsvN_Kv-I",abstract:"Toolkit research plays an important role in the field of HCI, as it can heavily influence both the design and implementation of interactive systems.

The problem is that toolkit evaluation is challenging, as it is often unclear what 'evaluating' a toolkit means and what methods are appropriate. To address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. From our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions.

In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car.

Astral combines and integrates display mirroring, sensor streaming and input remapping, where designers can exploit familiar desktop applications to prototype, explore and fine-tune dynamic interactive behaviours. With Astral, designers can visually author rules to test real-time behaviours while interactions take place, as well as after the interaction has occurred.

Evaluating AV-pedestrian interaction is challenging given limited availability of AVs and safety concerns. These challenges are compounded by \"mixed traffic\" conditions: studying AV-pedestrian interaction will be difficult in traffic consisting of vehicles varying in autonomy level. We propose immersive pedestrian simulators as design tools to study AV-pedestrian interaction, allowing rapid prototyping and evaluation of future AV-pedestrian interfaces. We present OnFoot: a VR-based simulator that immerses participants in mixed traffic conditions and allows examination of their behavior while controlling vehicles' autonomy-level, traffic and street characteristics, behavior of other virtual pedestrians, and integration of novel AV-pedestrian interfaces. We validated OnFoot against prior simulators and Wizard-of-Oz studies, and conducted a user study, manipulating vehicles' autonomy level, interfaces, and pedestrian group behavior. Our findings highlight the potential to use VR simulators as powerful tools for AV-pedestrian interaction design in mixed traffic.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"dis-2019-mahadevan.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"dis-2019-mahadevan.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/hri-2018-feick.json":{date:"2018-04",title:"The Way You Move: The Effect of a Robot Surrogate Movement in Remote Collaboration",authors:["Martin Feick","Lora Oehlberg","Anthony Tang","André Miede","Ehud Sharlin"],series:"HRI 2018",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3173386.3176959",pages:2,keywords:"movement trajectory & velocity, remote collaboration, robot surrogate",abstract:"In this paper, we discuss the role of the movement trajectory and velocity enabled by our tele-robotic system (ReMa) for remote collaboration on physical tasks.

Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children's stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child's playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children's stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children's mental health.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"imwut-2020-wang.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"imwut-2020-wang.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/people/kendra-wannamaker.json":{name:"Kendra Wannamaker",type:"master",dir:"content/output/people",base:"kendra-wannamaker.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"kendra-wannamaker.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/people/sasha-ivanov.json":{name:"Sasha Ivanov",type:"master",dir:"content/output/people",base:"sasha-ivanov.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"sasha-ivanov.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/tei-2019-mikalauskas.json":{date:"2019-03",title:"Beyond the Bare Stage: Exploring Props as Potential Improviser-Controlled Technology",authors:["Claire Mikalauskas","April Viczko","Lora Oehlberg"],series:"TEI 2019",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3294109.3295631",pages:9,keywords:"props, performer-controlled technology, improvisational theatre",abstract:"While improvised theatre (improv) is often performed on a bare stage, improvisers sometimes incorporate physical props to inspire new directions for a scene and to enrich their performance.

For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"tvcg-2019-walny.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"tvcg-2019-walny.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/vr-2019-satriadi.json":{date:"2019-03",title:"Augmented Reality Map Navigation with Freehand Gestures",authors:["Kadek Ananta Satriadi","Barrett Ens","Maxime Cordeil","Bernhard Jenny","Tobias Czauderna","Wesley Willett"],series:"IEEE VR 2019",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1109/VR.2019.8798340",keywords:"augmented reality, gesture recognition, human computer interaction, interactive devices",pages:11,abstract:"Freehand gesture interaction has long been proposed as a `natural' input method for Augmented Reality (AR) applications, yet has been little explored for intensive applications like multiscale navigation. In multiscale navigation, such as digital map navigation, pan and zoom are the predominant interactions. A position-based input mapping (e.g. grabbing metaphor) is intuitive for such interactions, but is prone to arm fatigue. This work focuses on improving digital map navigation in AR with mid-air hand gestures, using a horizontal intangible map display. First, we conducted a user study to explore the effects of handedness (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based). From these findings we designed DiveZoom and TerraceZoom, two novel hybrid techniques that smoothly transition between position- and rate-based mappings. A second user study evaluated these designs.

To unpack this problem, we conducted a lab study in which participants were free to use their own methods to discover the functionality of a connected set of interactive visualizations of public energy data.

This paper introduces a new way to embed dynamic and responsive graphics in the real world. In RealitySketch, the user draws graphical elements on a mobile AR screen and binds them with physical objects in real-time and improvisational ways, so that the sketched elements dynamically move with the corresponding physical motion. The user can also quickly visualize and analyze real-world phenomena through responsive graph plots or interactive visualizations.
