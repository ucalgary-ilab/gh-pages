These cues vary along three dimensions: the purpose of the cue, the visual design of the cue, and the circumstances under which the cue is shown. We demonstrate that this framework can also be used to describe interaction cues for augmented reality applications. Beyond this, we show how the framework can be used to generatively derive new design ideas for visual interaction cues in augmented reality experiences.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2018-dillman.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2018-dillman.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/people/william-wright.json":{"name":"William Wright","type":"masters","url":"http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~wwright/","scholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V4nRMoMAAAAJ","twitter":"https://twitter.com/HexenKoenig","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/bonadriel","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bon-adriel-aseniero-47140560/","dir":"content/output/people","base":"william-wright.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"william-wright.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2018-mahadevan.json":{"date":"2018-04","title":"Communicating Awareness and Intent in Autonomous Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction","authors":["Karthik Mahadevan","Sowmya Somanath","Ehud Sharlin"],"series":"CHI 2018","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174003","keywords":"autonomous vehicle-pedestrian interaction, perceived awareness and intent in autonomous vehicles","pages":12,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_hhcGVREGA","talk":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08OEKuz93dY","abstract":"Drivers use nonverbal cues such as vehicle speed, eye gaze, and hand gestures to communicate awareness and intent to pedestrians. Conversely, in autonomous vehicles, drivers can be distracted or absent, leaving pedestrians to infer awareness and intent from the vehicle alone. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car. We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2018-mahadevan.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2018-mahadevan.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2018-ledo.json":{"date":"2018-04","title":"Evaluation Strategies for HCI Toolkit Research","authors":["David Ledo","Steven Houben","Jo Vermeulen","Nicolai Marquardt","Lora Oehlberg","Saul Greenberg"],"series":"CHI 2018","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173610","keywords":"user interfaces, design, evaluation, prototyping, toolkits","pages":17,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lAwhCk60C4","talk":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOhsvN_Kv-I","abstract":"Toolkit research plays an important role in the field of HCI, as it can heavily influence both the design and implementation of interactive systems. For publication, the HCI community typically expects toolkit research to include an evaluation component. The problem is that toolkit evaluation is challenging, as it is often unclear what 'evaluating' a toolkit means and what methods are appropriate. To address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. From our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions. We identify and discuss the value of four toolkit evaluation strategies, including the associated techniques that each employs. We offer a categorization of evaluation strategies for toolkit researchers, along with a discussion of the value, potential limitations, and trade-offs associated with each strategy.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2018-ledo.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2018-ledo.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2019-danyluk.json":{"date":"2019-04","title":"Look-From Camera Control for 3D Terrain Maps","authors":["Kurtis Thorvald Danyluk","Bernhard Jenny","Wesley Willett"],"series":"CHI 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300594","keywords":"terrain, touch, map interaction, look-from camera control","pages":12,"abstract":"We introduce three lightweight interactive camera control techniques for 3D terrain maps on touch devices based on a look-from metaphor (Discrete Look-From-At, Continuous Look-From-Forwards, and Continuous Look-From-Towards).

We conducted two studies with ReMa, with two main findings. First, a shared perspective is more effective and preferred compared to the opposing perspective offered by conventional video chat systems. Second, the physical proxy and video chat complement one another in a combined system: people used the physical proxy to understand objects, and used video chat to perform gestures and confirm remote actions.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2018-feick.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2018-feick.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/people/anthony-tang.json":{"name":"Anthony Tang","type":"faculty","title":"Adjunct Associate Professor","url":"https://hcitang.github.io/","scholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RG1EQowAAAAJ","twitter":"https://twitter.com/proclubboy","github":"http://github.com/hcitang","dir":"content/output/people","base":"anthony-tang.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"anthony-tang.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/people/saul-greenberg.json":{"name":"Saul Greenberg","type":"faculty","title":"Emeritus Professor","url":"http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/","scholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TthhUuoAAAAJ","dir":"content/output/people","base":"saul-greenberg.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"saul-greenberg.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2020-anjani.json":{"date":"2020-04","title":"Why do people watch others eat food?

Astral combines and integrates display mirroring, sensor streaming and input remapping, where designers can exploit familiar desktop applications to prototype, explore and fine-tune dynamic interactive behaviours. With Astral, designers can visually author rules to test real-time behaviours while interactions take place, as well as after the interaction has occurred. We demonstrate Astral's applicability, workflow and expressiveness within the interaction design process through both new examples and replication of prior approaches that illustrate how various familiar desktop applications are leveraged and repurposed.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"dis-2019-ledo.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"dis-2019-ledo.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/iros-2020-hedayati.json":{"date":"2020-09","title":"PufferBot: Actuated Expandable Structures for Aerial Robots","authors":["Hooman Hedayati","Ryo Suzuki","Daniel Leithinger","Daniel Szafir"],"series":"IROS 2020","pages":6,"abstract":"We present PufferBot, an aerial robot with an expandable structure that may expand to protect a droneâs propellers when the robot is close to obstacles or collocated humans.

We propose immersive pedestrian simulators as design tools to study AV-pedestrian interaction, allowing rapid prototyping and evaluation of future AV-pedestrian interfaces. We present OnFoot: a VR-based simulator that immerses participants in mixed traffic conditions and allows examination of their behavior while controlling vehicles' autonomy-level, traffic and street characteristics, behavior of other virtual pedestrians, and integration of novel AV-pedestrian interfaces.

When readers wish to engage more deeply with the data, they can collect, arrange, compare, and navigate the document using the embedded word-scale visualizations, permitting more visualization-centric analyses.

The experiments show how view manipulation interactions helped readers examine embedded visualizations more quickly and with less scrolling and yielded qualitative feedback on usability and future opportunities.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2020-goffin.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2020-goffin.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/mobilehci-2019-hung.json":{"date":"2019-10","title":"WatchPen: Using Cross-Device Interaction Concepts to Augment Pen-Based Interaction","authors":["Michael Hung","David Ledo","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"MobileHCI 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3338286.3340122","keywords":"smartwatch, cross-device interaction, pen interaction, interaction techniques","pages":8,"abstract":"Pen-based input is often treated as auxiliary to mobile devices. We posit that cross-device interactions can inspire and extend the design space of pen-based interactions into new, expressive directions. We realize this through WatchPen, a smartwatch mounted on a passive, capacitive stylus that: (1) senses the usage context and leverages it for expression (e.g., changing colour), (2) contains tools and parameters within the display, and (3) acts as an on-demand output. As a result, it provides users with a dynamic relationship between inputs and outputs, awareness of current tool selection and parameters, and increased expressive match (e.g., added ability to mimic physical tools, showing clipboard contents). We discuss and reflect upon a series of interaction techniques that demonstrate WatchPen within a drawing application. We highlight the expressive power of leveraging multiple sensing and output capabilities across both the watch-augmented stylus and the tablet surface.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"mobilehci-2019-hung.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"mobilehci-2019-hung.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/imwut-2020-wang.json":{"date":"2020-06","title":"AssessBlocks: Exploring Toy Block Play Features for Assessing Stress in Young Children after Natural Disasters","authors":["Xiyue Wang","Kazuki Takashima","Tomoaki Adachi","Patrick Finn","Ehud Sharlin","Yoshifumi Kitamura"],"series":"IMWUT 2020","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3381016","keywords":"well being, toy blocks, PTSD, tangibles for health, stress assessment, play, children","pages":29,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxxvZBY80ug","abstract":"Natural disasters cause long-lasting mental health problems such as PTSD in children. Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children's stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child's playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children's stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children's mental health.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"imwut-2020-wang.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"imwut-2020-wang.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/people/nathalie-bressa.json":{"name":"Nathalie Bressa","type":"visiting","dir":"content/output/people","base":"nathalie-bressa.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"nathalie-bressa.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/uist-2020-suzuki.json":{"date":"2020-10","title":"RealitySketch: Embedding Responsive Graphics and Visualizations in AR through Dynamic Sketching","authors":["Ryo Suzuki","Rubaiat Habib Kazi","Li-Yi Wei","Stephen DiVerdi","Wilmot Li","Daniel Leithinger"],"series":"UIST 2020","keywords":"augmented reality, embedded data visualization, real-time authoring, sketching interfaces, tangible interaction","pages":16,"abstract":"We present RealitySketch, an augmented reality interface for sketching interactive graphics and visualizations. In recent years, an increasing number of AR sketching tools enable users to draw and embed sketches in the real world. However, with the current tools, sketched contents are inherently static, floating in mid air without responding to the real world. This paper introduces a new way to embed dynamic and responsive graphics in the real world. In RealitySketch, the user draws graphical elements on a mobile AR screen and binds them with physical objects in real-time and improvisational ways, so that the sketched elements dynamically move with the corresponding physical motion. The user can also quickly visualize and analyze real-world phenomena through responsive graph plots or interactive visualizations. This paper contributes to a set of interaction techniques that enable capturing, parameterizing, and visualizing real-world motion without pre-defined programs and configurations. Finally, we demonstrate our tool with several application scenarios, including physics education, sports training, and in-situ tangible interfaces.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"uist-2020-suzuki.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"uist-2020-suzuki.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/cnc-2019-hammad.json":{"date":"2019-06","title":"Mutation: Leveraging Performing Arts Practices in Cyborg Transitioning","authors":["Nour Hammad","Elaheh Sanoubari","Patrick Finn","Sowmya Somanath","James E.

For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tvcg-2020-walny.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tvcg-2020-walny.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/tvcg-2019-blascheck.json":{"date":"2019-06","title":"Exploration Strategies for Discovery of Interactivity in Visualizations","authors":["Tanja Blascheck","Lindsay MacDonald Vermeulen","Jo Vermeulen","Charles Perin","Wesley Willett","Thomas Ertl","Sheelagh Carpendale"],"series":"TVCG 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2802520","keywords":"discovery, visualization, open data, evaluation, eye tracking, interaction logs, think-aloud","pages":13,"abstract":"We investigate how people discover the functionality of an interactive visualization that was designed for the general public. While interactive visualizations are increasingly available for public use, we still know little about how the general public discovers what they can do with these visualizations and what interactions are available. Developing a better understanding of this discovery process can help inform the design of visualizations for the general public, which in turn can help make data more accessible. To unpack this problem, we conducted a lab study in which participants were free to use their own methods to discover the functionality of a connected set of interactive visualizations of public energy data. We collected eye movement data and interaction logs as well as video and audio recordings. By analyzing this combined data, we extract exploration strategies that the participants employed to discover the functionality in these interactive visualizations. These exploration strategies illuminate possible design directions for improving the discoverability of a visualization's functionality.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tvcg-2019-blascheck.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tvcg-2019-blascheck.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/tei-2019-mikalauskas.json":{"date":"2019-03","title":"Beyond the Bare Stage: Exploring Props as Potential Improviser-Controlled Technology","authors":["Claire Mikalauskas","April Viczko","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"TEI 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3294109.3295631","pages":9,"keywords":"props, performer-controlled technology, improvisational theatre","abstract":"While improvised theatre (improv) is often performed on a bare stage, improvisers sometimes incorporate physical props to inspire new directions for a scene and to enrich their performance.

We interviewed five professional improvisers about their use of physical props in improv, and their expectations of a possible augmented prop that controls technical theatre elements. We propose a set of guidelines for the design of an augmented prop that fits with the existing world of unpredictable improvised performance.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tei-2019-mikalauskas.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tei-2019-mikalauskas.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/vr-2019-satriadi.json":{"date":"2019-03","title":"Augmented Reality Map Navigation with Freehand Gestures","authors":["Kadek Ananta Satriadi","Barrett Ens","Maxime Cordeil","Bernhard Jenny","Tobias Czauderna","Wesley Willett"],"series":"IEEE VR 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VR.2019.8798340","keywords":"augmented reality, gesture recognition, human computer interaction, interactive devices","pages":11,"abstract":"Freehand gesture interaction has long been proposed as a `natural' input method for Augmented Reality (AR) applications, yet has been little explored for intensive applications like multiscale navigation. In multiscale navigation, such as digital map navigation, pan and zoom are the predominant interactions. A position-based input mapping (e.g. grabbing metaphor) is intuitive for such interactions, but is prone to arm fatigue. This work focuses on improving digital map navigation in AR with mid-air hand gestures, using a horizontal intangible map display. First, we conducted a user study to explore the effects of handedness (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based). From these findings we designed DiveZoom and TerraceZoom, two novel hybrid techniques that smoothly transition between position- and rate-based mappings. A second user study evaluated these designs. Our results indicate that the introduced input-mapping transitions can reduce perceived arm fatigue with limited impact on performance.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"vr-2019-satriadi.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"vr-2019-satriadi.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/booktitles.json":{"CHI":{"booktitle":"Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","publisher":"ACM, New York, NY, USA"},"UIST":{"booktitle":"Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","publisher":"ACM, New York, NY, USA"},"IMWUT":{"booktitle":"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies","publisher":"ACM, New York, NY, USA"},"DIS":{"booktitle":"Proceedings of the ACM on Designing Interactive Systems Conference","publisher":"ACM, New York, NY, USA"},"MobileHCI":{"booktitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services","publisher":"ACM, New York, NY, USA"},"TEI":{"booktitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction","publisher":"ACM, New York, NY, USA"},"HRI":{"booktitle":"Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction"},"dir":"content/output","base":"booktitles.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"booktitles.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"}},"sourceFileArray":["content/booktitles.yaml","content/labs.yaml","content/news.yaml","content/people/anthony-tang.yaml","content/people/ashratuz-zavin-asha.yaml","content/people/bon-adriel-aseniero.yaml","content/people/brennan-jones.yaml","content/people/carmen-hull.yaml","content/people/christopher-smith.yaml","content/people/darcy-norman.yaml","content/people/david-ledo.yaml","content/people/ehud-sharlin.yaml","content/people/jessi-stark.yaml","content/people/karthik-mahadevan.yaml","content/people/kendra-wannamaker.yaml","content/people/kurtis-danyluk.yaml","content/people/lora-oehlberg.yaml","content/people/martin-feick.yaml","content/people/nathalie-bressa.yaml","content/people/nicolai-marquardt.yaml","content/people/nour-hammad.yaml","content/people/roberta-cabral-mota.yaml","content/people/ryo-suzuki.yaml","content/people/sasha-ivanov.yaml","content/people/saul-greenberg.yaml","content/people/sheelagh-carpendale.yaml","content/people/soren-knudsen.yaml","content/people/sowmya-somanath.yaml","content/people/sydney-pratte.yaml","content/people/teddy-seyed.yaml","content/people/terrance-mok.yaml","content/people/tim-au-yeung.yaml","content/people/wesley-willett.yaml","content/people/william-wright.yaml","content/people/zachary-mckendrick.yaml","content/publications/chi-2018-dillman.yaml","content/publications/chi-2018-feick.yaml","content/publications/chi-2018-ledo.yaml","content/publications/chi-2018-mahadevan.yaml","content/publications/chi-2019-danyluk.yaml","content/publications/chi-2020-anjani.yaml","content/publications/chi-2020-goffin.yaml","content/publications/chi-2020-hou.yaml","content/publications/cnc-2019-hammad.yaml","content/publications/dis-2019-bressa.yaml","content/publications/dis-2019-ledo.yaml","content/publications/dis-2019-mahadevan.yaml","content/publications/hri-2018-feick.yaml","content/publications/imwut-2020-wang.yaml","content/publications/iros-2020-hedayati.yaml","content/publications/mobilehci-2019-hung.yaml","content/publications/tei-2019-mikalauskas.yaml","content/publications/tvcg-2019-blascheck.yaml","content/publications/tvcg-2020-walny.yaml","content/publications/uist-2020-suzuki.yaml","content/publications/vr-2019-satriadi.yaml"]};
