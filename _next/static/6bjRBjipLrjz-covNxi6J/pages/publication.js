In our discussion we analyze, in particular, the control-display space mapping between the different reference frames of the stereoscopic and monoscopic displays. We show how this mapping supports interactive data exploration, but may also lead to conflicts between the stereoscopic and monoscopic views due to users' movement in space; we resolve these problems through synchronization. To support our discussion, we present results from an exploratory observational evaluation with domain experts in fluid mechanics and structural biology. These experts explored domain-specific datasets using variations of a system that embodies the interaction modes and workflows; we report on their interactions and qualitative feedback on the system and its workflow.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"tvcg-2016-lopez.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"tvcg-2016-lopez.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"1kbU":function(e){e.exports={date:"2016-06",title:"Elevating Communication, Collaboration, and Shared Experiences in Mobile Video through Drones",authors:["Brennan Jones","Kody Dillman","Richard Tang","Anthony Tang","Ehud Sharlin","Lora Oehlberg","Carman Neustaedter","Scott Bateman"],series:"DIS 2016",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/2901790.2901847",keywords:"cscw, telepresence, video communication, shared experiences, teleoperation, drones, collaboration, hri",video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10hbJHIQVX8",pages:13,abstract:"People are increasingly using mobile video to communicate, collaborate, and share experiences while on the go.

In this paper, we study the use of semi-autonomous drones for video conferencing, where an outdoor user (using a smartphone) is connected to a desktop user who can explore the environment from the drone's perspective. We describe findings from a study where pairs collaborated to complete shared navigation and search tasks. We illustrate the benefits of providing the desktop user with a view that is elevated, manipulable, and decoupled from the outdoor user. In addition, we articulate how participants overcame challenges in communicating environmental information and navigational cues, negotiated control of the view, and used the drone as a tool for sharing experiences. This provides a new way of thinking about mobile video conferencing where cameras that are decoupled from both users play an integral role in communication, collaboration, and sharing experiences.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"dis-2016-jones.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"dis-2016-jones.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"3M7L":function(e){e.exports={date:"2020-10",title:"RealitySketch: Embedding Responsive Graphics and Visualizations in AR through Dynamic Sketching",authors:["Ryo Suzuki","Rubaiat Habib Kazi","Li-Yi Wei","Stephen DiVerdi","Wilmot Li","Daniel Leithinger"],series:"UIST 2020",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3379337.3415892",keywords:"augmented reality, embedded data visualization, real-time authoring, sketching interfaces, tangible interaction",award:"Honorable Mention",video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0p-BNU9rXU",pages:16,abstract:"We present RealitySketch, an augmented reality interface for sketching interactive graphics and visualizations. In recent years, an increasing number of AR sketching tools enable users to draw and embed sketches in the real world. However, with the current tools, sketched contents are inherently static, floating in mid air without responding to the real world. This paper introduces a new way to embed dynamic and responsive graphics in the real world. In RealitySketch, the user draws graphical elements on a mobile AR screen and binds them with physical objects in real-time and improvisational ways, so that the sketched elements dynamically move with the corresponding physical motion. The user can also quickly visualize and analyze real-world phenomena through responsive graph plots or interactive visualizations. This paper contributes to a set of interaction techniques that enable capturing, parameterizing, and visualizing real-world motion without pre-defined programs and configurations.

To examine the challenges of remote critique, we conducted an observational lab study in which participants critiqued pairs of physical prototypes (prosthetic hands) for a face-to-face or remote collaborator.

Our analysis suggests that people use the camera view deliberately to support their interactions-for example, to convey a message or to ask questions-but the limited field of view, and the lack of camera control can make it a frustrating experience.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2015-jones.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2015-jones.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2015-willett.json":{date:"2015-04",title:"Lightweight Relief Shearing for Enhanced Terrain Perception on Interactive Maps",authors:["Wesley Willett","Bernhard Jenny","Tobias Isenberg","Pierre Dragicevic"],series:"CHI 2015",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702172",keywords:"plan oblique relief, interaction, depth perception, terrain maps, relief shearing",pages:10,abstract:"We explore interactive relief shearing, a set of non-intrusive, direct manipulation interactions that expose depth and shape information in terrain maps using ephemeral animations. Reading and interpreting topography and relief on terrain maps is an important aspect of map use, but extracting depth information from 2D maps is notoriously difficult. Modern mapping software attempts to alleviate this limitation by presenting digital terrain using 3D views. However, 3D views introduce occlusion, complicate distance estimations, and typically require more complex interactions. In contrast, our approach reveals depth information via shearing animations on 2D maps, and can be paired with existing interactions such as pan and zoom. We examine explicit, integrated, and hybrid interactions for triggering relief shearing and present a version that uses device tilt to control depth effects. Our evaluation shows that these interactive techniques improve depth perception when compared to standard 2D and perspective views.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2015-willett.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2015-willett.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2015-oehlberg.json":{date:"2015-05",title:"Patterns of Physical Design Remixing in Online Maker Communities",authors:["Lora Oehlberg","Wesley Willett","Wendy E.

In this paper, we formalize the notion of physical data referents – the real-world entities and spaces to which data corresponds – and examine the relationship between referents and the visual and physical representations of their data. We differentiate situated representations, which display data in proximity to data referents, and embedded representations, which display data so that it spatially coincides with data referents. Drawing on examples from visualization, ubiquitous computing, and art, we explore the role of spatial indirection, scale, and interaction for embedded representations.

We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations.

Dynamic 3D Printing can assemble an arbitrary three-dimensional shape from a large number of small physical elements. Also, it can disassemble the shape back to elements and reconstruct a new shape. Dynamic 3D Printing combines the capabilities of 3D printers and shape displays: Like conventional 3D printing, it can generate arbitrary and graspable three-dimensional shapes, while allowing shapes to be rapidly formed and reformed as in a shape display. To demonstrate the idea, we describe the design and implementation of Dynablock, a working prototype of a dynamic 3D printer. Dynablock can form a three-dimensional shape in seconds by assembling 3,000 9 mm blocks, leveraging a 24 x 16 pin-based shape display as a parallel assembler. Dynamic 3D printing is a step toward achieving our long-term vision in which 3D printing becomes an interactive medium, rather than the means for fabrication that it is today.

To understand how people perceive "wind" generated from WindyWall, we conducted a pilot study of wind magnitude perception using different wind activation patterns from WindyWall. Our findings suggest that: horizontal wind activations are perceived more readily than vertical ones, and that people\'s perceptions of wind are highly variable-most individuals will rate airflow differently in subsequent exposures.

We propose a set of guidelines for the design of an augmented prop that fits with the existing world of unpredictable improvised performance.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"tei-2019-mikalauskas.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"tei-2019-mikalauskas.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"XJU/":function(e,t,i){var a=i("NegM");e.exports=function(e,t,i){for(var n in t)i&&e[n]?e[n]=t[n]:a(e,n,t[n]);return e}},XNPm:function(e){e.exports={date:"2018-04",title:"Communicating Awareness and Intent in Autonomous Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction",authors:["Karthik Mahadevan","Sowmya Somanath","Ehud Sharlin"],series:"CHI 2018",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174003",keywords:"autonomous vehicle-pedestrian interaction, perceived awareness and intent in autonomous vehicles",pages:12,video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_hhcGVREGA",talk:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08OEKuz93dY",abstract:"Drivers use nonverbal cues such as vehicle speed, eye gaze, and hand gestures to communicate awareness and intent to pedestrians. Conversely, in autonomous vehicles, drivers can be distracted or absent, leaving pedestrians to infer awareness and intent from the vehicle alone. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car. We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a

Existing Swarm UI applications are written using a robot programming framework: users work on a computer screen and think in terms of low-level controls. In contrast, our approach allows programmers to work in physical space by directly manipulating objects and think in terms of high-level interface design. Inspired by current UI programming practices, we introduce a four-step workflow-create elements, abstract attributes, specify behaviors, and propagate changes-for Swarm UI programming. We propose a set of direct physical manipulation techniques to support each step in this workflow. To demonstrate these concepts, we developed Reactile, a Swarm UI programming environment that actuates a swarm of small magnets and displays spatial information of program states using a DLP projector.

We differentiate situated representations, which display data in proximity to data referents, and embedded representations, which display data so that it spatially coincides with data referents. Drawing on examples from visualization, ubiquitous computing, and art, we explore the role of spatial indirection, scale, and interaction for embedded representations.

For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations.

Mention",abstract:"In the coming years, emergency calling services in North America will begin to incorporate new modalities for reporting emergencies, including video-based calling. The challenge is that we know little of how video calling systems should be designed and what benefits or challenges video calling might bring. We conducted observations and contextual interviews within three emergency response call centres to investigate these points. We focused on the work practices of call takers and dispatchers. Results show that video calls could provide valuable contextual information about a situation and help to overcome call taker challenges with information ambiguity, location, deceit, and communication issues. Yet video calls have the potential to introduce issues around control, information overload, and privacy if systems are not designed well. These results point to the need to think about emergency video calling along a continuum of visual modalities ranging from audio calls accompanied with images or video clips to one-way video streams to two-way video streams where camera control and camera work need to be carefully designed.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2018-neustaedter.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2018-neustaedter.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"yYy+":function(e,t,i){"use strict";i.r(t);var a=i("pbKT"),n=i.n(a),o=i("0iUn"),s=i("sLSF"),r=i("Tit0"),c=i("MI3g"),l=i("a7VT"),p=i("q1tI"),u=i.n(p);i("IujW");function d(e){var t=function(){if("undefined"==typeof Reflect||!n.a)return!1;if(n.a.sham)return!1;if("function"==typeof Proxy)return!0;try{return Date.prototype.toString.call(n()(Date,[],function(){})),!0}catch(e){return!1}}();return function(){var i,a=Object(l.default)(e);if(t){var o=Object(l.default)(this).constructor;i=n()(a,arguments,o)}else i=a.apply(this,arguments);return Object(c.default)(this,i)}}var h=function(e){Object(r.default)(i,e);var t=d(i);function i(){return Object(o.default)(this,i),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(s.default)(i,[{key:"render",value:function(){return u.a.createElement("footer",null,u.a.createElement("div",{className:"ui center aligned container"},u.a.createElement("div",{className:"ui section divider"}),u.a.createElement("img",{style:{maxWidth:"180px",margin:"30px auto"},src:"/static/images/logo-6.png"}),u.a.createElement("div",{className:"content"},u.a.createElement("img",{style:{maxWidth:"200px",margin:"0px auto"},src:"/static/images/logo-4.png"}),u.a.createElement("div",{className:"sub header"},"Department of Computer Science"))))}}]),i}(u.a.Component);t.default=h},zRIs:function(e){e.exports={date:"2015-04",title:"Lightweight Relief Shearing for Enhanced Terrain Perception on Interactive Maps",authors:["Wesley Willett","Bernhard Jenny","Tobias Isenberg","Pierre Dragicevic"],series:"CHI 2015",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702172",keywords:"plan oblique relief, interaction, depth perception, terrain maps, relief shearing",pages:10,abstract:"We explore interactive relief shearing, a set of non-intrusive, direct manipulation interactions that expose depth and shape information in terrain maps using ephemeral animations. Reading and interpreting topography and relief on terrain maps is an important aspect of map use, but extracting depth information from 2D maps is notoriously difficult. Modern mapping software attempts to alleviate this limitation by presenting digital terrain using 3D views. However, 3D views introduce occlusion, complicate distance estimations, and typically require more complex interactions. In contrast, our approach reveals depth information via shearing animations on 2D maps, and can be paired with existing interactions such as pan and zoom. We examine explicit, integrated, and hybrid interactions for triggering relief shearing and present a version that uses device tilt to control depth effects. Our evaluation shows that these interactive techniques improve depth perception when compared to standard 2D and perspective views.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2015-willett.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2015-willett.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},zXhZ:function(e,t,i){var a=i("5K7Z"),n=i("93I4"),o=i("ZW5q");e.exports=function(e,t){if(a(e),n(t)&&t.constructor===e)return t;var i=o.f(e);return(0,i.resolve)(t),i.promise}}},[["mDBt","5d41","9da1"]]]);
