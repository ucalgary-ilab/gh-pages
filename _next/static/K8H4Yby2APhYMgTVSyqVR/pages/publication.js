In recent years, an increasing number of AR sketching tools enable users to draw and embed sketches in the real world. However, with the current tools, sketched contents are inherently static, floating in mid air without responding to the real world. This paper introduces a new way to embed dynamic and responsive graphics in the real world. In RealitySketch, the user draws graphical elements on a mobile AR screen and binds them with physical objects in real-time and improvisational ways, so that the sketched elements dynamically move with the corresponding physical motion. The user can also quickly visualize and analyze real-world phenomena through responsive graph plots or interactive visualizations. This paper contributes to a set of interaction techniques that enable capturing, parameterizing, and visualizing real-world motion without pre-defined programs and configurations. Finally, we demonstrate our tool with several application scenarios, including physics education, sports training, and in-situ tangible

Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children's stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child's playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children's stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children's mental health.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"imwut-2020-wang.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"imwut-2020-wang.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"},"content/output/publications/tvcg-2019-blascheck.json":{date:"2019-06",title:"Exploration Strategies for Discovery of Interactivity in Visualizations",authors:["Tanja Blascheck","Lindsay MacDonald Vermeulen","Jo Vermeulen","Charles Perin","Wesley Willett","Thomas Ertl","Sheelagh Carpendale"],series:"TVCG 2019",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2802520",keywords:"discovery, visualization, open data, evaluation, eye tracking, interaction logs, think-aloud",pages:13,abstract:"We investigate how people discover the functionality of an interactive visualization that was designed for the general public.

Developing a better understanding of this discovery process can help inform the design of visualizations for the general public, which in turn can help make data more accessible. To unpack this problem, we conducted a lab study in which participants were free to use their own methods to discover the functionality of a connected set of interactive visualizations of public energy data. We collected eye movement data and interaction logs as well as video and audio recordings. By analyzing this combined data, we extract exploration strategies that the participants employed to discover the functionality in these interactive visualizations.

This work focuses on improving digital map navigation in AR with mid-air hand gestures, using a horizontal intangible map display. First, we conducted a user study to explore the effects of handedness (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based).

These interaction techniques support an active reading experience and engage readers through exploration of embedded visualizations whose placement and content connect them to specific terms in a document. A reader could, for example, use our proposed interaction techniques to explore word-scale visualizations of stock market trends for companies listed in a market overview article. When readers wish to engage more deeply with the data, they can collect, arrange, compare, and navigate the document using the embedded word-scale visualizations, permitting more visualization-centric analyses. We support our design space with a concrete implementation, illustrate it with examples from three application domains, and report results from two experiments. The experiments show how view manipulation interactions helped readers examine embedded visualizations more quickly and with less scrolling and yielded qualitative feedback on usability and future opportunities.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2020-goffin.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2020-goffin.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},M9HE:function(e){e.exports={date:"2019-06",title:"AV-Pedestrian Interaction Design Using a Pedestrian Mixed Traffic Simulator",authors:["Karthik Mahadevan","Elaheh Sanoubari","Sowmya Somanath","James E.

Evaluating AV-pedestrian interaction is challenging given limited availability of AVs and safety concerns.

We propose immersive pedestrian simulators as design tools to study AV-pedestrian interaction, allowing rapid prototyping and evaluation of future AV-pedestrian interfaces. We present OnFoot: a VR-based simulator that immerses participants in mixed traffic conditions and allows examination of their behavior while controlling vehicles' autonomy-level, traffic and street characteristics, behavior of other virtual pedestrians, and integration of novel AV-pedestrian interfaces. We validated OnFoot against prior simulators and Wizard-of-Oz studies, and conducted a user study, manipulating vehicles' autonomy level, interfaces, and pedestrian group behavior.

Conversely, in autonomous vehicles, drivers can be distracted or absent, leaving pedestrians to infer awareness and intent from the vehicle alone. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car. We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"chi-2018-mahadevan.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"chi-2018-mahadevan.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},YYe3:function(e,t,a){var n={"./chi-2018-dillman.json":"EnfY","./chi-2018-feick.json":"EnQq","./chi-2018-ledo.json":"tyxG","./chi-2018-mahadevan.json":"XNPm","./chi-2019-danyluk.json":"v0jR","./chi-2020-anjani.json":"ZlYZ","./chi-2020-goffin.json":"M695","./chi-2020-hou.json":"+yqD","./cnc-2019-hammad.json":"ctjq","./dis-2019-bressa.json":"KMRZ","./dis-2019-ledo.json":"llnM","./dis-2019-mahadevan.json":"M9HE","./hri-2018-feick.json":"cJDD","./imwut-2020-wang.json":"hpIb","./iros-2020-hedayati.json":"9ed3","./mobilehci-2019-hung.json":"h56d","./tei-2019-mikalauskas.json":"U6lc","./tvcg-2019-blascheck.json":"xLid","./tvcg-2020-walny.json":"DjNc","./uist-2020-suzuki.json":"3M7L","./vr-2019-satriadi.json":"slZ3"};function o(e){var t=i(e);return a(t)}function i(e){var t=n[e];if(!(t+1)){var a=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw a.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",a}return t}o.keys=function(){return Object.keys(n)},o.resolve=i,e.exports=o,o.id="YYe3"},ZW5q:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("eaoh");function o(e){var t,a;this.promise=new e(function(e,n){if(void 0!==t||void 0!==a)throw TypeError("Bad Promise constructor");t=e,a=n}),this.resolve=n(t),this.reject=n(a)}e.exports.f=function(e){return new o(e)}},ZlYZ:function(e){e.exports={date:"2020-04",title:"Why do people watch others eat food?

Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children's stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child's playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children's stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions.

Developing a better understanding of this discovery process can help inform the design of visualizations for the general public, which in turn can help make data more accessible. To unpack this problem, we conducted a lab study in which participants were free to use their own methods to discover the functionality of a connected set of interactive visualizations of public energy data. We collected eye movement data and interaction logs as well as video and audio recordings. By analyzing this combined data, we extract exploration strategies that the participants employed to discover the functionality in these interactive visualizations. These exploration strategies illuminate possible design directions for improving the discoverability of a visualization's functionality.",dir:"content/output/publications",base:"tvcg-2019-blascheck.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"tvcg-2019-blascheck.yaml",sourceExt:".yaml"}},"yYy+":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n=a("pbKT"),o=a.n(n),i=a("0iUn"),s=a("sLSF"),r=a("Tit0"),c=a("MI3g"),l=a("a7VT"),u=a("q1tI"),d=a.n(u);a("IujW");function p(e){var t=function(){if("undefined"==typeof Reflect||!o.a)return!1;if(o.a.sham)return!1;if("function"==typeof Proxy)return!0;try{return Date.prototype.toString.call(o()(Date,[],function(){})),!0}catch(e){return!1}}();return function(){var a,n=Object(l.default)(e);if(t){var i=Object(l.default)(this).constructor;a=o()(n,arguments,i)}else a=n.apply(this,arguments);return Object(c.default)(this,a)}}var h=function(e){Object(r.default)(a,e);var t=p(a);function a(){return Object(i.default)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(s.default)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return d.a.createElement("footer",null,d.a.createElement("div",{class:"ui center aligned container"},d.a.createElement("div",{class:"ui section divider"}),d.a.createElement("img",{style:{maxWidth:"60px",margin:"30px auto"},src:"/static/images/logo-3.png"}),d.a.createElement("div",{className:"content"},d.a.createElement("h1",{style:{fontSize:"2.2rem"}},"Interactions Lab"),d.a.createElement("div",{className:"sub header"},"University of Calgary",d.a.createElement("br",null),"Department of Computer Science")),d.a.createElement("img",{style:{maxWidth:"200px",margin:"0px auto"},src:"/static/images/logo-1.png"})))}}]),a}(d.a.Component);t.default=h},zXhZ:function(e,t,a){var n=a("5K7Z"),o=a("93I4"),i=a("ZW5q");e.exports=function(e,t){if(n(e),o(t)&&t.constructor===e)return t;var a=i.f(e);return(0,a.resolve)(t),a.promise}}},[["mDBt","5d41","9da1"]]]);
